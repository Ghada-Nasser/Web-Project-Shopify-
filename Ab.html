                    <p>Shopify started sending flowers online in 2004 from our headquarters in Egypt. Like all projects, we started out small as a website that offered a few select bouquets and we still remember the emotion of receiving our very first <br><br>

                        Over the course of the last 15 years we have grown steadily thanks to the trust placed in us by our customers. Today, Shopify is a leading company in the world for sending flowers. We are also able to speedily ship fresh flowers to more than 100 countries around the world. <br><br>
                        
                        We have also accumulated numerous online trust stamps over the years that attest to Shopify's commitment to good Internet business practice, as well our responsibility for the protection of our customers and users.</p>

                         regardless of the day or time of delivery. To guarantee that we can respond to the
                          needs of our users we have developed a unique business model. This combines two
                           possibilities for sending flowers depending on the delivery date or destination:
                            bouquets arranged by our inhouse team of florists or by local florists around the world.</p>

                    <h3>FRESH FLOWERS IN OUR ORIGINAL BOX</h3>
            <p>    If the order has been made at least 24 hours in advance and to some European
                     destinations, the flowers will arrive in our distinctive Shopify box. They will be
                   prepared with fresh flowers selected by us from the best growers, and arranged by
                  our expert florists in our bouquet creation centers in Spain, Italy and Germany. To
                   ensure a punctual delivery we entrust the transport of your flowers to couriers with a
                    choice of a morning or afternoon delivery slot. Receiving a bouquet of fresh flowers
                    from Shopify in our original box is a truly magical experience.
