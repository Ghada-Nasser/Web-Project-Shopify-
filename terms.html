        Here at Shopify, authenticity is important to us. This is why we prepare our bouquets by hand and select only the freshest flowers.
        Although we strive to make sure your bouquet looks as similar as possible to the original product photo, 
        there may be some slight variations.

        That’s the wonderful thing about working with a living product: every floral arrangement is unique. Even so, we guarantee that all our bouquets conform to the same concept and offer the quality you expect from us. Some of our bouquets may include added products, like a soft toy or chocolates. Please note that the photo displays an example of these products, and that the brand or model we send depends on availability. But don’t worry: we will make sure the item received is of a similar quality to the one displayed on our website. If you receive a product that differs slightly from the original photo, but that complies with the necessary quality standards, 
        we cannot offer any kind of refund or send any new product.
